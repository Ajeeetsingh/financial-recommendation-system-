Financial Product Recommendation System
Overview
The Financial Product Recommendation System is a web-based application that recommends financial products (mutual funds, stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on user preferences. Built as a portfolio project, it leverages natural language processing (NLP) and vector search to match user queries (e.g., "low-risk mutual fund") with a synthetic dataset of 500 financial products. The system uses sentence-transformers for query embeddings, Chroma for vector storage, and a Streamlit UI for user interaction, deployed via ngrok for public access in Google Colab.
This project showcases skills in:

NLP: Embedding user queries with sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Vector Search: Storing and querying embeddings with Chroma.
Web Development: Building an interactive UI with Streamlit.
Data Science: Processing a synthetic financial dataset.
Deployment: Hosting a web app using ngrok.

Features

Query Processing: Enter preferences (e.g., "low-risk sustainable funds") to get personalized recommendations.
Filters: Customize results by risk level (Low, Medium, High), minimum return (0–15%), and maximum expense ratio (0–2%).
Recommendation Engine: Retrieves top-5 products ranked by semantic similarity, using cosine distance in Chroma.
Streamlit UI: User-friendly interface with text input, dropdowns, sliders, and formatted results.
Synthetic Dataset: 500 financial products with attributes (Name, Description, Risk, Return, Expense Ratio).
Public Access: Deployed via ngrok for external access.

Note: The synthetic dataset (financial_products.csv) and Chroma database (chroma_db/) are generated by the notebook to keep the repository lightweight. Alternatively, you can include them if preferred (see Setup).
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Google Colab Account: Free tier (GPU optional).
Google Drive: To store financial_products.csv and chroma_db.
ngrok Account: Free account for public URL generation. Sign up at ngrok.com and get your authtoken.
Python Libraries: Installed automatically in the notebook (sentence-transformers, chromadb, pandas, streamlit, pyngrok).
Browser: For accessing the Streamlit UI via ngrok.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the project in Google Colab.
Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone or download the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-recommendation-system.git


Upload files to Google Colab:

Open colab.research.google.com.
Click File > Upload Notebook and select recommendation_system.ipynb.
Upload app.py to the Colab file system (drag-and-drop or Files > Upload).



Step 2: Set Up Google Drive

Mount Google Drive to store files:
In the notebook, run the cell to mount Drive (follow the authentication prompt).


Create a project folder:
Run the cell to create /content/drive/MyDrive/recommendation_system/.



Step 3: Run the Notebook
The notebook (recommendation_system.ipynb) contains four days of implementation:

Day 1: Generate a synthetic dataset (financial_products.csv).
Day 2: Create a Chroma database with query embeddings.
Day 3: Implement the recommendation engine (recommend_products).
Day 4: Launch the Streamlit app via ngrok.


Install Dependencies:
Run the first cell to install required libraries.


Generate Dataset and Database:
Run Day 1 and Day 2 cells to create financial_products.csv and chroma_db/ in /content/drive/MyDrive/recommendation_system/.
If you included these files in the repository, copy them to /content/ using the provided cells.


Test Recommendation Logic:
Run Day 3 cells to test the recommendation engine with sample queries (e.g., “low-risk mutual fund”).


Launch Streamlit App:
Run the Day 4 cell to start the Streamlit app.
Replace YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN with your authtoken from ngrok.com.
Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., https://<random>.ngrok.io) and open it in a browser.



Step 4: Use the Streamlit App

In the Streamlit UI:
Enter a Query: Type a preference (e.g., “low-risk mutual fund”).
Set Filters:
Risk: Select “Low”, “Medium”, “High”, or “Any”.
Min Return: Adjust slider (0–15%).
Max Expense Ratio: Adjust slider (0–2%).


Get Recommendations: Click “Get Recommendations” to see top-5 products.


Example:
Query: “low-risk sustainable funds”
Risk: Low
Min Return: 5.0%
Max Expense Ratio: 1.0%
Expected: ~4–5 Low-risk sustainable funds with Return >= 5.0%, Expense Ratio <= 1.0%.



Step 5: Stop the App

Press Ctrl+C in the Colab cell to stop Streamlit and ngrok.

Troubleshooting

ngrok Errors:
Invalid Authtoken: Verify your token at ngrok.com.
Tunnel Limit Exceeded: Run !pkill ngrok and retry.


File Not Found:
Ensure financial_products.csv and chroma_db/ are in /content/drive/MyDrive/recommendation_system/.
Re-run Day 1 and Day 2 cells to generate them.


Streamlit Crashes:
Re-install libraries in a new cell: !pip install streamlit pyngrok sentence-transformers chromadb pandas.
Check Colab output for errors.


No Results:
Verify Chroma database has 500 items (check Day 2 output).
Test query in Day 3 cells to debug the recommendation engine.



Future Improvements

Display results in a table using st.dataframe.
Add a reset button to clear inputs.
Enhance UI with custom CSS for a polished look.
Test edge cases (e.g., empty queries, strict filters) for robustness.
